# ESP266 SmartConfig with AES CBC Encryption for NonOS (Android only)

Arduino ESP8266 is based on NonOS SDK so ESPTOUCH v2 AES encryption is not avaialble on NonOS SDK.
So I made this project demonstrate how to encrypt the WiFi password and transmit it to 
ESP8266 and decrypt it and connect to WiFi network.
